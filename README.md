# Elliptica BigNum Calcum with spreadsheets
### Big Number Calculator

This is the pre-first start version of my simple calculator which serves
the need of computing with big numbers i.e. numbers with 64-bit precision
or approximately 19-digits decimal precision.

The app also handles raw text.

Additional functionality can be added by custom functions.
